The Answers Analyzer provides a comprehensive dashboard to analyze Qlik Answers metadata across a Qlik Cloud tenant.

It provides the ability to:

- Track user questions across knowledgebases, assistants, and source documents
- Analyze user behavior to see what types of questions users are asking about what content
- Optimize knowledgebase sizes and increase answer accuracy by removing inaccurate, unused, and unreferenced documents
- Track and monitor page size to quota
- Ensure that data is kept up to date by monitoring knowledgebase index times
- Tie alerts into metrics, (e.g. a knowledgebase hasn't been updated in over X days)
